Enhancements in this version:

* Fixed the conflict of the previous version with the Left$ and Right$ functions

* Numeric input type now accepts only one decimal point

* Added the multiliner property

* Added the control over the groove color

* Added disabled state and colors for
	-> Backcolor
	-> Border Color
	-> Border Pattern
	-> Groove

I suggest compiling it into an ocx for better performance.

God Bless!!
